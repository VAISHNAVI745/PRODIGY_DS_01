# PRODIGY_DS_01
Python Project – Global Population Data Visualization

This Python project visualizes global population data by gender and age group across countries and years. It uses pandas for data cleaning, custom logic to synthesize gender and age groups, and Plotly/Matplotlib/Seaborn for dynamic visualizations.

🔍 Features

Cleaned and transformed raw Excel data using pandas

Added synthetic Gender (Male/Female) and Age Groups (0–14, 15–29, 30–59, 60+)

Displayed key metrics: Total, Male, Female, Child (0–14), and Senior (60+) populations

Implemented year-based filtering using interactive widgets (e.g., Streamlit, Dash, or IPyWidgets)

Bar chart: Population by Gender

Histogram: Age Group distribution

Fully interactive, clean layout with responsive visuals
